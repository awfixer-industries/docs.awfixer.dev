  <Accordion title="Identify Setup Scripts">
      We do our best to ship setup scripts in multi-lang projects that cover setting up and enviorment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Decide how to use the setup script">
      if you are on an operating system like nixos, it may be best to use a flake enviorment, if your on a
      different operating system, you might want to use Devcontainers or GitPod, all of which fit into our
      development flow, which has been perfected to work on the project at hand

  <Accordion title="Check out or creat the branch you would like to work on">
      our security policies on our repos force you to make a PR in order to merge your changes
      (don't worry, this is something that applies to everyone but the core-developer team,
      in case they need to override the protections)

  <Accordion title="identify the `Git` Scripts">
      We have a special way that we notate PRs and Commits, We use a set of scripts to accomplish this
      - PRs need to have a conventional name like "feat:"
      - Commits should be a list of modified files in the commit, so we can track down any new bugs
