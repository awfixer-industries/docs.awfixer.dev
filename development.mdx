<h1>
    We Have an extremely specific dev setup, ensuring that as development continues we are always on track for any pipelines or develery schedules
</h1>

<p>
This process involves a lot of automation, as well as 3+ different platforms. The Pipeline and Cycle is layed out below

<h3>
    Stop One - Github Dev Repos
</h3>

<AccordionGroup>
 <Accordion title="Github Dev Repos Purpose">
    The dev Repos are the inital gate in our infrastructure, allowing the code to be inspected and tested when it first joins the codebase
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Code Signing">
    When the code is commited, the first step is to verify that it is signed and authenticated. If the code is not tagged as verifed, it will be rejected
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pull Requests only please">
    We do not accept code that is not submitted in the form of a properly formatted Pull Request to our Development Repos, this ensures that all code is inspected the same way
    and allows the workflows to check for any bugs before we move it along in the proccess of development
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No AI/LLM Generated Code Please">
    While we do use AI and LLMs to inspect the code, we do not accept any Generated code. Pull requests found to have Generated code in them will be closed and the Contributer will be
    forbidden from opening further pull requests and issues
