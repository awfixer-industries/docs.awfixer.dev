<h1>
    What is Rustfox?
</h1>

  <Accordion title="Terms and Usages">
      Throughout this section "Rustfox" we use the terms 'Cold Turkey' and 'Back to basics' a lot, in the
      context of this documention what is being referred to is the art of freezing development so that the
      code base can be fully converted rather than also fighting with developing functions during a mass
      translation
  </Accordion>

<p align="justify">

Rustfox is a reset, a cold turkey switch, a back to basics moment with the [Firefox](https://firefox.com) browser. It is the idea that by freezing feature development
and focusing entirely on converting and modernizing the codebase, we will make the browser a faster, more private, and more secure piece of software
